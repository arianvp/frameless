* Frameless
Frameless is a CSS framework that does it right. It is written in
Sass.

** Features
Frameless is in early development and not yet ready for production.

*** TODO Flexbox-based grid system.
A grid system based on flexbox. Because of the principle of separation
of concerns, this is not a bunch of CSS classes, but rather a bunch of
Sass mixins. HTML should not mention any of this.

*** TODO Normalized form fields, buttons and links
It should be easy to style different kinds of form fields, buttons and
links.
 - Text fields, password fields, email address fields and the like, as
   well as text areas.
 - Buttons, submit buttons and reset buttons.
 - Links and link-like buttons.

*** TODO Margins and line heights for, inter alia, paragraphs and list items
Never again undergo the pain of having to do this yourself. Again, these
are just mixins; you have to provide the values you want yourself.
